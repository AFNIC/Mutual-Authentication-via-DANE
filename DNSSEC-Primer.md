In PKIX, data origin authentication is provided by the digital certificate. TLS provides confidentiality and data integrity. Data is encrypted only during transmission, and the data stored in the server end is not encrypted. In the case of DNSSEC, the data at the server end, i.e. in the DNS zone, is encrypted using the public and private keys. Hence data in the DNS zone is encrypted before being transmitted in the network. In the PKIX model at the client end, an HTTP user agent such as a web browser is used for validation. In DNSSEC, a validating resolver is used to verify the integrity of the transmitted data.
