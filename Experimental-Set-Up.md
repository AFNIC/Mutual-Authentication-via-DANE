To Test our hypothesis of using Self-Signed Certificates for the IP space, A CA provisioning infrastructure [*Figure 3*](/Figures/CA_Provisioning_Architecture.png)) was set up, where Afnic emulated the Root CA role and generated intermediate certificates for two LoRaWAN - TSP (Telecom Sud Paris) and Afnic Labs. Complete details on setting up the infrastructure is provided in the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/AFNIC/IoTRoam-Tutorial/blob/master/QuickStart.md)
