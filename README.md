# Mutual Authentication of Backend elements in LoRaWAN using DNS Infrastructure
This document describes the concept of replacing the trust and security schemes based on the traditional PKI with a novel approach that relies on the DNS (Domain Naming Service) infrastructure and its extended security standards. The concept of using DNS-based PKI is validated on LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). 

## Objective 
Objective of this document is to help users to understand how DNS based PKI enables seamless mutual authentication between the Backend Elements (i.e. the [JS, NS and the AS](https://github.com/AFNIC/Mutual-Authentication-via-DANE/blob/main/LoRaWAN-Background.md)) of the LoRaWAN.
