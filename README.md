# Mutual Authentication of Backend elements in LoRaWAN using DNS Infrastructure
This document describes the concept of replacing the trust and security schemes based on the traditional PKI with a novel approach that relies on the DNS (Domain Naming Service) infrastructure and its extended security standards. The concept of using DNS-based PKI is validated on LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). 

## Objective 
Objective of this document is to help users to understand how DNS based PKI enables seamless mutual authentication between the Backend Elements (i.e. the JS, NS and the AS) of the LoRaWAN.
