# Mutual Authentication of Backend elements in LoRaWAN using DNS Infrastructure


## This document describes the concept of replacing the trust and security schemes based on the traditional PKI with a novel approach that relies on the DNS (Domain Naming Service) infrastructure and builds all the required functionalities upon DNS. 

We plan to validate our hypothesis of using DNS-based PKI on LPWAN (Low-Power Wide Area Networks), considered the most resource-constrained IoT networks, and then extend them to other types of networks. If the DNS-based PKI work for LPWAN, it should also work for other less constrained networks.
