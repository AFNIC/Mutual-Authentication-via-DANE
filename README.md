# Mutual Authentication of Backend elements in LoRaWAN using DNS Infrastructure

This document describes the concept of replacing the trust and security schemes based on the traditional PKI with a novel approach that relies on the DNS (Domain Naming Service) infrastructure and its extended security standards. The concept of using DNS-based PKI is validated on LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network).
