## LoRaWAN Brief Background

IoT connectivity technologies could be classified broadly into three categories: Short Range (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Zwave), Medium range (WiFi) and Long-range (LoRa, NB-IoT, Wi-Sun, Sigfox). We plan to validate our hypothesis of using DNS-based PKI on LPWAN (Low-Power Wide Area Networks), considered the most resource-constrained IoT networks, and then extend them to other types of networks. If the DNS-based PKI work for LPWAN, it should also work for other less constrained networks. 

In the LPWAN category, we short-listed LoRaWAN since, compared to other IoT connectivity technologies, the LoRaWAN ecosystem provides the freedom to its stakeholders to make their own choices in choosing the ED manufacturers, Service providers, and applications providers. Since the radio connectivity uses a license-free spectrum, the freedom of choice in LoRaWAN extends to deployment options. Public LoRaWAN has nationwide coverage;  private LoRaWAN focuses on specific use-cases and community networks that can be used for free by end-users. 

LoRaWAN is an asymmetric protocol with a star topology  as shown in the [*Figure 9*](/images/lw-key-dist.jpg). Data transmitted by the LoRaWAN End-Device (ED) is received by a Radio Gateway (RG), which relays it to a Network Server (NS). The NS decides on further processing the incoming data based on the ED’s unique identifier (DevEUI). The NS has multiple responsibilities like forwarding the uplink from the ED to the Application Server (AS), queuing the downlink from the AS to the ED, forwarding the ED onboarding request to the appropriate AA (Authentication & Authorization) servers, named as Join Server (JS) in LoRaWAN terminology. While the ED is connected to the RG via LoRa modulated *RF messages*, the connection between the RG, the NS and the AS is done through *IP traffic* and can be backhauled via Wi-Fi, hardwired Ethernet or Cellular connection.

The JS acting as the AA server controls the terms on how the ED gets activated (i.e., onboarded) to a selected LoRaWAN.  There are two types of ED activation: ***Over the Air Activation (OTAA)*** and ***Activation by Personalization (ABP)***. With ABP, the ED is directly connected to a LoRaWAN by hardcoding the cryptographic keys and other parameters required for secured communication. With OTAA, the parameters necessary to create a secured session between the ED and the servers in the Internet are created dynamically. This secured session is similar to the TLS handshake used in the HTTPS connection. OTAA is preferred over ABP since it is dynamic, decouples the ED and the backend infrastructure, and doesn’t need session keys to be hardcoded. 

The ED performs a Join procedure (i.e. the onboarding process) with the JS during OTAA by sending the Join Request (JR). The JR payload contains the ED’s unique identifier (i.e. the ***DevEUI***), the cryptographic AES-128 root keys: ***NwkKey***, ***AppKey*** and ***JoinEUI*** (unique identifier pointing to the JS). The JS associated with the ED  has preliminary information such as the ED’s ***DevEUI***, the cryptographic keys: ***NwkKey*** and ***AppKey*** (as shown in the [*Figure 9*](/images/lw-key-dist.jpg)) required for generating session keys to secure the communication between the ED and the NS and AS.
