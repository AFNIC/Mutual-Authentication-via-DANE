## LoRaWAN brief background

In the LPWAN category, we short-listed LoRaWAN since, compared to other IoT connectivity technologies, 
the LoRaWAN ecosystem provides the freedom to its stakeholders to make their own choices in choosing the 
ED manufacturers, Service providers, and applications providers. Since the radio connectivity uses a license-free spectrum,
the freedom of choice in LoRaWAN extends to deployment options. Public LoRaWAN has nationwide coverage;  private 
LoRaWAN focuses on specific use-cases and community networks that can be used for free by end-users.
